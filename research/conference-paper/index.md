abstract: Access to high-value markets can improve farmers’ well-being, provided that these markets remunerate quality. Classical economic theory, under a scenario of perfect information, holds that the price received by producers reflects the quality of their product. Therefore, it implies that produce-quality determines a farmer’s access to such high-value markets. However, in practice, producers or buyers cannot readily evaluate a product’s quality. In this case study, we explore the effect of mitigating such asymmetry of information (on product quality) on access to high-value markets. Specifically, we consider the effect of quantifying and certifying coffee-quality on the price received by small coffee growers in eight municipalities of Colombia’s Nariño department, between 2012 and 2016. Using an econometric methodology of ‘differences in differences’, we find that providing small coffee-growers with technical and commercial advice, alongside a ‘coffee cup test’, increases, on average, their sale price of coffee by $2,710 (COP/kg), in comparison with coffee farmers who did not receive this support. Additionally, we demonstrate that this effect is heterogeneous for the coffee farmers who received the treatment, due to the varying agroecological conditions of the different farms.
